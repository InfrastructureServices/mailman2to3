# ------------------  EDIT THE CORRECT FILE  -------------------------
# 
# This file is copied to /etc/cron.d/mailman from
# @prefix@/cron/crontab.in when the mailman service is started via its
# init.d script and the file /etc/cron.d/mailman is removed when the
# service is stopped.  Therefore any edits made directly to
# /etc/cron.d/mailman will be lost anytime the mailman service
# restarts.
#
# To make changes edit the master copy @prefix@/cron/crontab.in and then
# restart the service to pick up the changes (/sbin/service mailman restart).
#
# The reason this is done this way is because the mailman cron jobs
# should only be invoked if the mailman service is enabled and not
# just as a consequence of installing the rpm as was the case
# previously. The file /etc/cron.d/mailman cannot simply be linked to
# the master copy in @prefix@/cron because for security reasons cron
# will not process crontab files that are links or writeable by
# anybody else but root, thus the file must be copied into /etc/cron.d
# with the right ownership and permissions.
#
# At 8AM every day, mail reminders to admins as to pending requests.
# They are less likely to ignore these reminders if they're mailed
# early in the morning, but of course, this is local time... ;)
